Notes:

Log-linear space complexity (O(n log n)) indicates that the memory usage grows logarithmically with the input size and linearly with the depth of recursion.
In the example, Merge Sort algorithm is used to sort the input array. While the time complexity is O(n log n), the space complexity also becomes O(n log n) due to the recursive calls and additional space required for merging.
Merge Sort divides the array into halves recursively and merges them back together in sorted order, resulting in log-linear space usage.
Key Takeaway:

Log-linear space complexity is achieved when the memory usage grows logarithmically with the input size and linearly with the depth of recursion.
Algorithms with log-linear space complexity, like Merge Sort, are efficient for sorting large datasets and exhibit predictable memory usage proportional to the input size.
