# Big O Analysis

This repository contains examples demonstrating various time and space complexities in computer algorithms. Understanding the concept of Big O notation is essential for analyzing the performance of algorithms as input sizes grow.

I created this repository for personal reference, and I hope it also serves as a helpful resource for others who want to understand Big O and experiment with different complexities.
